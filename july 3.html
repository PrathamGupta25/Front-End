        <article>Kalki 2898 AD (pronounced [kə.l.kɪ]) is a 2024 Indian Telugu-language epic science fiction film[7] directed by Nag Ashwin and produced by Vyjayanthi Movies. The film stars an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Kamal Haasan, Prabhas and Deepika Padukone. Inspired by Hindu scriptures, it is the first installment in a planned Kalki Cinematic Universe. Set in a post-apocalyptic world in the year 2898 AD, the film follows a select group on a mission to save Kalki, the unborn child of SUM-80, a lab subject.

            The film was officially announced in February 2020 under the tentative title Prabhas 21, as it is the actor's 21st film in the lead role and was later changed to working title Project K. Principal photography commenced a year later in July 2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic. It was shot sporadically in several legs over the next three years, and wrapped by late-May 2024. The official title was announced in July 2023. The film has music composed by Santhosh Narayanan, cinematography handled by Serbian cinematographer Djordje Stojiljkovic and editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao. Made on a ₹600 crore (US$72 million) production budget, it is the most expensive Indian film.[8]
            
            Kalki 2898 AD was initially scheduled to release on 9 May 2024, but was postponed due to unfinished production works. It was released worldwide on 27 June 2024 in standard, IMAX, 3D and 4DX formats, and set several box office records for a Telugu and Indian film.</article><br>
